# Clinch Posture

**Purpose:** To list the basics of clinch posture

Proper clinch posture enables you to maintain good posture so you can defend, attack, and maneuver strongly.  Here are a few points to keep in mind:

- Keep head position straight up and down.  Look down your nose at your opponent like a mean girl  Don't bend down at the neck which makes it easier for your opponent to pull your head forward to break your posture.  
- When you enter in a clinch step your rear so your hips are square with your opponent to remove vulnerability to foot picks of your lead leg.
- Have a stance with duck feet to keep you stable in a clinch.
- Lower back should be in position as if you are doing good morning exercise.
