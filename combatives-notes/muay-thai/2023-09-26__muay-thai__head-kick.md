# Head Kicks

**Purpose:** Head kicks attack targets at the biceps and above.  Clean hits to the neck can result in an instant knockout in a similar way that a karate chop to the neck works.  Solid hits to the head's knock-out points, like the jaw and temple, could also produce knockouts.  If anything, head hits are demoralizing and pose a real threat, and can be used to set up body and leg attacks.  Targeting the biceps weakens the opponent's arms over time, thereby keeping their guard high and protecting their head.  

Head kicks have a longer distance to travel and are much slower than most other attacks, so use the hands to set up the head kick like any kick.

## Mechanics of a Head Kick

1. Swing kicking leg straight up like an ax kick aimed to miss just to the side of the head.
2. With your supporting leg on the balls of the foot, turn the hips at the last moment to drive the shin into your opponent's neck, head, or bicep.

## Combinations using Head Kicks 

- Cross followed with right head kick (Shadow kick)

- Any combination that ends in a leg kick, then do the same combination later, but end with a head kick

- After a combination ending with a right leg kick, fake a right check lift, then step the foot down, but closer to the lead leg than the starting rear leg stance position. As your rear foot touches the mat, push off to step with the lead foot and then execute the right head kick.

- Couple head kick as reload after a body kick: Right body kick then reload a right head kick.

- After using a pull-back evade defense, counter immediately with a head kick

## Defense against the Head Kick

- Two Point Block
- Two Point with leg catch
- Pull back evade defense
- In general, mirror side blocking is safer than cross-body blocking
