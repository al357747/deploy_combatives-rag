# 21 Rules of Standup Fighting

**Purpose:** These rules are sparring guidelines for new students

## 1) Hands Up

Hold hands up with palms at eyebrow level, with forearms in place to defend against Muay Thai elbow attacks.  

In general, with an active guard, palms can face towards each other when you and your opponent are at a distance and are still stalking each other.

When managing the distance to keep your opponent outside of the pocket. Your hands can be held open-palmed toward the opponent to deflect or glove catch your opponent's punches into the bony part of your palm as you maneuver away and around your opponent.

When you are in the pocket with your opponent trading punches, keep your palms facing towards you to maintain a strong guard.  The arm mechanics of the palms facing you are strong enough to prevent your opponent from swatting your guard down with punches. This position also allows you to quickly shell into an eleven position.


## 2) Chin Down

Your front neck muscles brace your chin down and jaw line down from punches that could generate momentum to your skull and cause your brain to rattle, causing a concussion, which can result in a knockout.

Shrug your shoulders to protect your chin from a clean shot.

## 3) Sit Down

Bend your knees in a fighting stance to enable your hips to move into the correct position while you punch, kick, or defend.

## 4) Move Head with feet

Head movements depend on movements of your feet.  You cannot effectively remain balanced while evading punches with head movements while your feet are static.  You move your head by moving your feet appropriately.  Support your head movement defense by keeping your hands up, palms at eyebrow height, to deflect punches as you move.

## 5) Outside Range- Circle Left or Right away from Power

When outside the pocket, circle away from your opponent's rear power hand as a general rule.

You can circle towards the power hand side if you do so with purpose and intent, such as to avoid being trapped against the ropes or the corner of the ring.  But when circling to the power side, do so mindfully, but ensuring you are outside the range of the power hand, or you keep the power hand busy by attacking the power hand with double jabs or the opponent's head or body to keep them busy from attacking you.

## 6) Inside Range - Circle towards the side where you finished your combination

Circle to the left if you finish with a left punch or kick, or circle to the right if you finish with a right punch or kick.  Your opponent will still be reacting to your last attack as you pivot to that side, which prevents them from hitting you as you circle.  As an additional option while circling, use your guard and shoulder to jam their side, locking up their weapon to prevent it from attacking you.

## 7) Always Fake or Feint

Fake or Feint before attacking, during your attacking combinations, or as you exit to generate high cognitive load on your opponent to keep them guessing with how best to react to your maneuvers.

## 8) Be First

Strive to be first to attack and land an attack. To keep your opponent reactive.

## 9) Be Last

Be the last to complete an attack during an exchange to demoralize your opponent.

## 10) Be Gone

Exit quickly after you complete your attack to avoid a counterattack.

## 11) Never Take Without Giving

Always be the last to attack in an exchange.

## 12) Return at least two to five attacks for everyone received.

## 13) Punch when kicked

It takes time for your opponent to recover after kicking you, and it is quicker for you to return a punching counter than a kicking counter.

In general, an opponent who is good at kicking would be easier to out-punch.


## 14) Kick when Punched

Your opponent's legs are vulnerable during punching. 

In general, opponents who are good at punching fighting would be weaker in a kicking match.

## 15) Clinch when Rocked

## 16) Hands Set up kicks

Punch first or fake punches before kicking. Kicking takes time to execute so set them up with your hands.

## 17) Always Hit out of Clinch

When disengaging from a clinch, give yourself time to exit by hitting your opponent to keep them busy or put them off balance.

## 18) Dictate center of the ring

## 19) Cut opponent off (stalk them, don't chase them)

Use tracking to put pressure on them or cut them off to keep in one side of the ring.

## 20) Always change your attacks

## 21) When you score "Blitz" with good defense


# Common Sparring Mistakes

**Purpose:** Avoid the following common mistakes.

## 1) Backing up more than three times wieh someone is bearing down on you

You need to circle out within three steps so as not be overrun by your opponent's attack

## 2) Focu on attacking when you are already losing

Focus on good defense to regain confidense to mount a good comeback.

## 3) Doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result

Change it up instead of trying to make something work.

## 4) Trying to look cool

Focus on the fight instead of trying to impress the audience.

## 5) Thinking about the end, before you have enven gotten through the now

## 6) Not acting for more than three seconds

Do something.  Jab, fake, feint, manuever, attack.  Give your opponent something to think about.

## 7) Believing that you have won before you really have

Keep your mind on the present even if you are doing well.  Focus on the now to win the fight.

## 8) Using anger to try to win

Anger is fear in disguise, and does not serve as a substitute of focused detached thinking.
