# leg catch escapes

**Purpose:**  Counter your opponent's defensive maneuver to your body kick, the leg catch

## Turn knee down

You threw a body kick, and your opponent caught and trapped it with his mirror arm against his torso. Immediately, turn your hip toward the centerline of your opponent until your front hip and knee of the kicking leg face down toward the mat.  Point the toe of your foot so that the top of your foot does not get caught on your opponent's arm. Then pull your foot forward so it slips out from between your opponent's arm and torso, thereby freeing your leg. With your back to your opponent, you can keep stepping out of range from your opponent or deliver a side kick with your newly freed leg.

## Push your opponent away with your foot on his hip

With your leg caught by your opponent after your kick, immediately position your foot so that it is against the front of his hip. Push his hip away with your foot, and as he backs up, yank your foot free. You may need to repeat this several times while maintaining your balance by hopping on your supporting leg. Once free, you can follow up with a combination attack on your opponent or exit.

## shin barrier (or knee shield)

If your opponent catches your leg after you throw your body kick, immediately pull your opponent towards with your leg so you can use your hands to hold him while you use your shin to push against his hips and torso to create a push-pull hold on your opponent and give you a chance to get your balance. Once stable you can stomp down with your trapped leg to try to break his hold and free your leg.  With your leg free clinch your opponent and decide what to do from there.
