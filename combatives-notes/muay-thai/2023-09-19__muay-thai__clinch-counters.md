# General Mindset when Clinch fighting

**Purpose:** Describe a clinch flow of counters from the starting position of a double collar tie clinch.

When in a clinch, don't struggle but stay calm until you get an opportunity. If you struggle haphazardly, you make yourself vulnerable to elbow strikes.  Focus on good posture.

# Double Collar Tie Counter

From the starting position of double collar tie, the person in the double collar tie will reach over an arm and push his palm against the face of this opponent to pivot him 90 degrees trap his arm in a reverse armbar like position.  His Head and shoulder Will trap the wrist and his arm that is pushing his opponent's face will trap the elbow. With his other arm he will support his face pushing arm by push the back of the hand that pushing his opponent's face. His support arm will thread between his opponents arms that has the double collar tie.

## Counter to the palm on the face

While you have your opponent in a double collar tie, when he reaches over one of your arms to push your face, you will immediately feed that arm to the other side of your head so that the arm that's still hooking his head can push deeper behind his head to go around his neck elbow deep.  You can use your side of your head to trap his other arm and place your opponent in a standing arm triangle. From here you can take your opponent down or you can choke him.

## Counter to the Arm Triangle Counter

You are in your opponent's double collar tie and you reach over one arm to counter push the side of his face. As you attempt to do so he counters you by trying to fold your arm over the other side of his head to try to get you in an arm triangle.  Before he is able to lock up the arm triangle, you take your top arm and swim out of that arm triangle by lifting it over both your heads and swinging it around over his far arm so that you can trap his arm in modified americana.
