# Sparring notes 

**Purpose:** These sparring feedback from Kru or teammates

## Sparring feedback

- Don't hold your breath when kicking.  Exhale when you kick

- Lead with your shoulders when kicking to follow-through

- You have too many movements when initiating a punch.

- You are dropping the punching hand when pulling back to guard.  Punch then pull back directly to guard

- Follow through on your punches.
