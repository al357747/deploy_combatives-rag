# Long Guard and Double Long Guard

**Purpose:**  Both the long guard and double long guard are active defensive reactions meant to disrupt your opponent as they initiate an attack. They are intended to be held for a short period (one to three beats). Their purpose is to create an opportunity to respond quickly with a counter, the success of which determines whether you can mount a follow-up combination or escape the attack.


## Long Guard

The basic long guard position is the straight lead arm, positioned to post on your opponent's forehead as they close in on you with their attack.  Your posting arm acts like a wall. You do not reach for your opponent's forehead, but your straight arm becomes a barrier that your opponent runs into as they try to move in aggressively.

Your lead shoulder shrugs up so your chin can tuck behind it to be protected from a cross or a hook against the orthodox fighter.  

Your rear arm has different positions depending on what you need to defend from your opponent. Position it as a regular guard to defend against jabs. Your right hand can reach behind your right ear to position or your arm to protect your head from the lead hook. Reach your right arm across your face and anchor your hand on your left bicep to protect your face against spear elbows or position your right elbow to cover below your chin to protect against uppercuts. Reach your right hand up to cover your left temple, palm outward, to protect against right hooks aimed at your head.

When your opponent pauses their attack, you can shift your lead hand palm from holding their forehead to their chest to push them back and make space, so you can follow up with a kick or just exit from the pocket. If your opponent starts throwing hooks in your long guard, they open up their centerline for you to take inside position to control inside of their elbows or head in a clinch.

## Double Long Guard

You can also use both arms straight out with your palms side by side to control the center, to deflect straight punches from your opponent as you retreat. You can fortify your retreat by balancing and bouncing on one leg while your other leg is knee up ready to check kicks or teep your opponent's body. Normally, in this position, as your opponent's attack runs out of steam, it gives you the opportunity to teep your opponent to disrupt their balance, and now you can follow up with your own attack, such as round kicks to the body, punches, etc.  The main goal of the double long guard is to form a wedge with both arms, deflecting straight punches while the raised lead leg protects against kicks.  If your opponent starts throwing arcing shots like hooks and uppercuts they open up their center torso which you can then take advantage of with your arms by going for double arm control at the back of their elbows for clinch or shove them back by pushing the center of their chest with your arms then follow with another kick or other combination.
