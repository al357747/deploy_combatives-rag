## Tracking Maneuver

**Purpose:**  Develop a pressure finish

Josh gave us an exercise with a partner where the partner moves in the striker tracks the partner. In tracking, stay in front of your partner as he maneuvers to maintain front pressure as opposed to trying to evade or react. 

Tracking is like stalking your partner and preventing him from maneuvering you into a corner. It is like you are hunting him down for a strike.


## Drills

- Shadow boxing drill: perfrom one to 6 punches after a kick when shadow boxing.
- With a partner or on a bag: Do 10 punches then a power jab and a right kick.
