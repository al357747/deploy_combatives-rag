# Knee Strike in clinch details

Start with an in-fighting stance, with your hands held high as if you are throwing a soccer ball in bounds.

## Clinch Entry steps

- Lead hand thread between the opponent's guard to hook behind your opponent's head.
- Bring your rear foot square with your lead foot while your rear hand hooks around the other side of your opponent's head.
- Maintain balance by keeping your feet in a duck foot position
- Shuffle your feet to load a leg to throw a knee into your opponent's body
- Throw one or two knees into your opponent's body and then turn your opponent 90 degrees so you can either throw more knees or push off to disengage.

### Pad Drill

- Pad holder holds her hand up in a guard position to give the striker the chance to practice entering the clinch position
- Pad holder holds the pads so the striker can practice knees to the body.
- Pad holder can then hold the pads so that the striker can strike with the elbows, and so the striker can push out to disengage
- Striker can then keep after disengaging to practice maintaining distance or stopping the opponent from coming back into the clinch
