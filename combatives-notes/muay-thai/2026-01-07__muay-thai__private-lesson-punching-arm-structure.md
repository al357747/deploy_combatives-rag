# Punching Structure

**Purpose:**  This is to discuss to details of proper body structure when punching

## Punch so that your shoulder covers your jaw

This applies to jabs, crosses, and hooks.  Your punching arm will protect your head from punches on your striking side.  While shadow boxing target the nose of your imaginary opponent to raise your punching arm.

In general, your shoulders should always be in position to protect your jawline even before punching.  You should feel the sensation that your shoulders are one piece.  Your shoulder muscles should be tense enough to maintain this sensation without being overly tense to waste energy.  You should feel your back muscle being able to easily rotate your shoulder structure around your spine in relation to your hips.  This rotation is what generates the power in your straight punches, hooks, and uppercuts.  When you have a solid stance with legs and hips, the core muscles rotates generates the rotational power of your shoulders that you deliver to your target with your punch arm.

## Your other arm protects the other side of your head

By holding your other arm in a guard position, you make your shoulder a solid piece needed to efficently transfer the rotation power of your core.  The arm position becomes a shield against counter punches from your opponent. It is also, in a cocked position ready to deliver a follo-up up punch as part of a combination. It is also ready to move in the arm swing position needed to generate power for a kick.
