# Footwork-angling

## Step Angle Left

1. Step the lead foot to the outside left, away from your opponent's centerline.

2. Follow with your rear foot so that you have a solid fighting stance facing your opponent's right side flank, and your opponent is in punching range.

3. Fire a rear cross 

## Step Angle Right

## Power Left

**Purpose:** A faster maneuver than the regular step pivot to your opponent's right flank.

1) Step the lead foot deep to the outside left, away from your opponent's centerline.

2) Power switch your feet, so your rear foot lands where your lead foot initially stepped, and your lead foot is positioned towards your opponent, placing you in a solid fighting stance facing your opponent's right side flank, and your opponent is in punching range.

3)  Load a rear cross and release.
