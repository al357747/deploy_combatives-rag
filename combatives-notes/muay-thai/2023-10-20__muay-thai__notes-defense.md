# John's feedback Defense

**Purpose:** John's feedback on head movement, distance management, and turtling up the shoulders.

## Head Movement

To head slip and roll, keep your head moving to enable head movement defense when needed. Head movement defense from a still head is hard.

## Distance Management

Keep your lead toe just short of your opponent's lead toe line when throwing uppercuts and liver shots

## Turtling Head and Shoulders

Sink your head into your raised shoulders to protect your jaw while punching, even for uppercuts and liver shots.
